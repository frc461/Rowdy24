461's robot code for the 2024 season

Some Notes:

  If you are interested in reading the most recent code, be sure to check branches other than master. Our latest code is always developed in seperate dev branches before being
  tested and merged back into master.

  A quick note on auto: dev-branch auto code is normally experimental and may (will) have issues. if you are interested in using our auto code, we advise you use the code in
  master instead of one of the dev branches.
  
  Our drivetrain is made up of 4 SDS-l3 swerve drives with NEO brushless motors for rotation and propulsion and CTRE CanCoders to measure wheel rotation.
