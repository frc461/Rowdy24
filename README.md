# FRC 461 Rowdy24 Robot Software

## Notes (Contributions, Structure, etc.)

  1. The programming subteam splits into different groups to work on different subsystems/ideas via branches. Our latest code is always developed in separate branches before being
  tested and merged back into master. Explore different specialized branches for your interest. If a certain subsystem is not being developed in a specific branch, it has either already been worked on or hasn't been yet.

  2. If you are interested in deploying our Robot/Auto code, we advise that you use the master branch instead of others, as they are experimental and may (will) cause issues. Use other branches at your own risk.
  
  3. Our drivetrain is made up of 4 SDS MK4-L3.5 swerve drives with NEO brushless motors (soon to be KRAKEN) for rotation and propulsion and CTRE CanCoders to measure wheel rotation.
  
  4. This project has a command-based structure. You can read more about WPILib command-based programming in the [WPILib Docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html).
