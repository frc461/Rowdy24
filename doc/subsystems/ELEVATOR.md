# Elevator Documentation

The elevator uses two CTRE Falcon 500 motors that are facing opposite directions. There is a limit switch at the bottom to rezero the elevator every time it goes back down to the stowed position. We use it to score in the amp and climb in endgame. We have a servo with a latch attached to it that serves as a latch during endgame to keep the robot hanging on the chain instead of falling to the ground once the elevator motors do not have power.
