# Constants Class Documentation

The `Constants` class contains all the values that are set once and do not change. Some examples are the ids for motors, the PID values for each motor, and positional limits for each motor. These values do no change once set and they are used to make the code more readable by keeping all the numerical values in one place and giving a meaning to each number in the code.
